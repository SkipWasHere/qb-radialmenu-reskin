# qb-radialmenu-reskin
This is qb-radialmenu reskin to black and grey. I have added a few things to it like gps/blips, give keys, set stash. I have configured this to make server that have owners/developers who dont know how to do much stuff much still wants a nice reskin and more to add into the config as a lot of the qb-radialmenu I tried the gps/blips were broken.
